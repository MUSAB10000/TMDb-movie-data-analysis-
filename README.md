  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

## Project Steps

1. **Data Wrangling** – Loading the dataset, assessing its quality and structure.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, fixing data types, removing duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Asking and answering interesting questions using visualizations and statistics.
4. **Conclusions** – Summarizing insights gained from the analysis.
